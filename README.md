## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## Thanks for checking out this Loopstudios landing page.

- This is my first challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) the challenges helped me to improve my coding skills by building this realistic project. 

## The challenge

This challenge helped me build out the landing page and get it to look as close to the given design.

This challenge focuses on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included.

My users can:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
